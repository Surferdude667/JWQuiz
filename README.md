<h1>Known issues:</<h1>

<h2>(The whole networking part of the app needs refactoring).</h2>

<h3>
- If that app don't load the JSON before start button is pressed it crashes.<br><br>
- If there is no internet the images are simply not loaded, but nothing crashes.<br><br>
- UI only optimized for iPhone X & Max and later for now.<br><br>
- Conflicting constraints warnings in console should be looked at, however everything works.
